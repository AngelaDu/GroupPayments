# GroupPayments
A personal Google Apps Script code written for my roommates and I to figure out who owes who. The demo below expresses how it works in conjunction to an aesthetic input graph. This was designed to be easy enough to use so that any of my roommates can use it by themselves! We currently have data from May 1 - May 13.
